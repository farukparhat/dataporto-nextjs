# Dataporto: Defining the Governed Data Economy

## Today: Broken Data Sharing

Organizations need to exchange data with customers, partners, and even competitors.
But today’s options are broken:

- **APIs**: Expensive to build, brittle, and hard to govern at scale
- **File transfers (CSV, SFTP)**: Static, insecure, and non-compliant
- **Warehouse-native shares (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.)**: Powerful, but siloed to single platforms and lack contract enforcement

As a result, enterprises face **compliance risks, vendor lock-in, and costly engineering overhead** — all while AI models hunger for more data.

## Tomorrow: The Governed Data Economy

In the next 5 years, data will be **shared, traded, and monetized** just like software and APIs are today.
Enterprises will demand:

- **Cross-cloud interoperability** (Snowflake ↔ Databricks ↔ BigQuery ↔ Iceberg ↔ S3)
- **Governed data contracts** (expiring, auditable, enforceable)
- **Compliance by design** (lineage, masking, sovereignty, expiration)
- **AI-ready feeds** (live, governed, zero-copy data streams)

Just as SaaS contracts became standardized in the 2010s, **data contracts** will become the new normal in the 2020s.

## Dataporto: The Bridge

**Short-Term (Now):**
Dataporto enables companies to **easily share data with clients in their preferred platforms** — starting with **Snowflake Data Shares**, the most in-demand enterprise format today.
We remove the complexity of setting up Snowflake, managing pipelines, and provisioning reader accounts, so vendors can meet client expectations instantly.

**Long-Term (Future):**
Dataporto is building the **infrastructure that powers the global data economy** — a governed, interoperable layer where data flows across clouds, regions, and platforms with **trust, compliance, and enforceable contracts**.

## Real-World Examples

- **Retail ↔ Payments**: Store performance data shared in return for AI-powered cannibalization and forecasting insights
- **Healthcare ↔ Pharma**: Clinical outcomes exchanged for predictive drug interaction models
- **SaaS Vendor ↔ Market Intelligence Firm**: Sales data shared in return for competitor benchmark datasets
- **Logistics ↔ E-commerce**: Delivery data traded for AI-driven demand forecasting

## The Category

Dataporto is not just a tool.
We are creating the category of **Governed Data Sharing as a Service (DSaaS)** — delivering value today through **Snowflake-native sharing** and building the **trust & governance layer for tomorrow’s AI-driven data economy**.
