# üö® Problems Dataporto Solves (by Priority)

---

### **1. Meeting Enterprise Customer Demands**

- **Problem:** Enterprise clients increasingly require data via **Snowflake Data Sharing**, Databricks Delta Sharing, or sFTP.
- **Without Dataporto:** Vendors lose deals, appear ‚Äúless enterprise-ready,‚Äù or waste engineering cycles building ad-hoc pipelines.
- **With Dataporto:** Instantly deliver governed data shares across Snowflake, Databricks, and sFTP ‚Äî making your product enterprise-grade.

---

### **2. Eliminating Pipeline Maintenance**

- **Problem:** Engineering teams spend months building and years maintaining fragile data pipelines to serve customers.
- **Without Dataporto:** Constant firefighting (schema drift, broken jobs, scaling issues), high infra costs, and missed SLAs.
- **With Dataporto:** Fully managed ingestion, staging, and delivery ‚Äî no custom ETL/ELT code or ongoing ops.

---

### **3. Simplifying Multi-Client Governance**

- **Problem:** Different customers need different slices of data, with strict access controls and auditing.
- **Without Dataporto:** Messy scripts, duplicated databases, and poor governance.
- **With Dataporto:** Centralized catalog, fine-grained access controls, masking/partitioning, and audit logs for compliance.

---

### **4. Avoiding Snowflake (or Databricks) Ownership Burden**

- **Problem:** Vendors without Snowflake accounts must buy, manage, and learn Snowflake just to deliver a single client share.
- **Without Dataporto:** High upfront cost, steep learning curve, and vendor lock-in.
- **With Dataporto:** We run Snowflake/Databricks infra on your behalf, with optional reader accounts ‚Äî no vendor Snowflake license required.

---

### **5. Accelerating Time to Market**

- **Problem:** Vendors lose weeks/months of development before they can deliver their first data share.
- **Without Dataporto:** Delayed enterprise deals and slower adoption.
- **With Dataporto:** **Zero-code onboarding** and instant delivery methods ‚Äî turning data sharing into a same-day capability.

---

### **6. Reducing Security & Compliance Risks**

- **Problem:** Ad-hoc file exports (CSV, S3 buckets, APIs) are insecure, lack governance, and raise compliance red flags.
- **Without Dataporto:** Risk of data leaks, regulatory non-compliance, lost trust.
- **With Dataporto:** **Live, zero-copy, governed data access** that meets enterprise expectations.

---

### **7. Supporting Multiple Delivery Methods**

- **Problem:** Every customer prefers a different way of receiving data (Snowflake, Databricks, sFTP).
- **Without Dataporto:** Vendors must build & maintain parallel delivery pipelines.
- **With Dataporto:** One system delivers data in the format/method each client prefers.
