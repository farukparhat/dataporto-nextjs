# Dataporto Vision

Data is becoming the most valuable global resource — one that will be **shared, traded, and monetized** between organizations.
To power the age of **AI-driven intelligence**, enterprises need infrastructure that makes data sharing **secure, governed, and cross-platform**.

---

## The Challenge

Today, sharing data across **clouds, regions, and warehouses** is complex and risky.
AI models need diverse, trusted datasets — but without **enforceable contracts, expiration, and auditability**, sharing is broken.

---

## The Solution

**Dataporto is the first true governed Data Sharing as a Service (DSaaS).**
We enable:

- **Cross-cloud interoperability** (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, S3, Postgres, Iceberg, etc.)
- **Governed contracts** with expiration, alerts, and fine-grained access
- **AI-ready feeds** that are compliant, live, and zero-copy

---

## Examples

- _Retail ↔ Payments_: Store performance, prospective location data exchanged for AI-powered forecasting insights (RBI <> Mastercard)
- _Healthcare ↔ Pharma_: Clinical outcomes shared for AI drug discovery models
- _Logistics ↔ E-commerce_: Delivery data traded for AI demand forecasting
- _QSR Brands ↔ Market Intelligence Firm_: **Sales data shared in return for competitor benchmark datasets** (RBI <> Circana)

---

## The Next 5 Years

- Data contracts will become as common as APIs
- AI will drive demand for diverse, governed datasets
- Vendors will monetize **AI-ready data products**
- Compliance will require **expiration, lineage, and consent auditing**

---

**Dataporto is building the trust and governance layer for the global AI-driven data economy.**
