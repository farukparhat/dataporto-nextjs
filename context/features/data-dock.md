### 🌊 Data Dock — Self-Serve Data Sharing

**Data Dock by Dataporto** lets your enterprise clients manage their own data subscriptions.
Instead of your team manually provisioning every integration, you set up a **Data Dock** and your clients can:

- 🔌 **Connect their warehouse or endpoint**
  Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, BigQuery, or sFTP

- 📂 **Subscribe to datasets**
  Tables, views, or curated schemas you’ve exposed

- ⏱️ **Control delivery settings**
  Real-time, scheduled, or batch refresh

- 🔒 **Stay governed and secure**
  Vendor-defined rules for access, masking, audit logs

**Why it matters:**
Vendors eliminate custom integration overhead, while clients get instant, enterprise-grade data access — all through a branded, embeddable portal powered by Dataporto.
