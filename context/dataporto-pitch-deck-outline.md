# Slide 0: Opening Vision

🌍 **Data is becoming the world’s most valuable resource.**
It will be **shared, traded, and monetized** just like software and APIs.
But today, data sharing is still **broken, insecure, and siloed.**

👉 The world needs **governed, trusted infrastructure** to power the coming **AI-driven data economy.**

# Slide 1: The Problem — Broken Data Sharing

**Today, companies need to share data with customers, partners, and even competitors.**
But the options are flawed:

- **APIs** → Expensive, brittle, hard to govern
- **File transfers (CSV, SFTP)** → Static, insecure, compliance nightmare
- **Native warehouse shares (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.)** → Powerful but siloed and lack contract enforcement

⚠️ Result:

- High engineering costs
- Compliance and sovereignty risks
- AI models starved of diverse, high-quality data

# Slide 2: The Solution — Dataporto

**Short-Term (Today):**

- Enable vendors to share data in the **formats their clients demand**
- Start with **Snowflake Data Shares** — the most requested enterprise standard
- Zero-code setup, full governance, reader account provisioning

**Long-Term (Future):**

- Build the **governed, interoperable layer** for the global data economy
- Cross-cloud, cross-region, cross-platform data contracts
- Expiring, auditable, enforceable connections powering **AI-ready data feeds**

✨ **Dataporto = Governed Data Sharing as a Service (DSaaS)**

# Slide 3: The Category — The Governed Data Economy

**Real-World Examples:**

- _Retail ↔ Payments_: Store sales data exchanged for forecasting insights
- _Healthcare ↔ Pharma_: Clinical outcomes shared for AI drug discovery models
- _SaaS ↔ Market Intelligence_: Sales data shared in return for competitor benchmark datasets
- _Logistics ↔ E-commerce_: Delivery data traded for AI demand forecasts

**The Next 5 Years:**

- Data contracts as common as SaaS contracts
- Vendors monetizing **AI-ready datasets**
- Compliance requiring expiration, lineage, consent tracking

🚀 **Dataporto is creating the category of Governed Data Sharing as a Service (DSaaS).**
We deliver value today with Snowflake — and own the infrastructure for tomorrow’s AI-driven data economy.
