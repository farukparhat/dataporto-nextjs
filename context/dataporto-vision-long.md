# Dataporto Vision & Manifesto

## The Future of Data

Data is evolving into a global resource that will be **shared, traded, bought, and sold** between organizations.
Just as oil powered the industrial age and APIs powered the digital age, **governed data sharing** will power the age of **AI-driven intelligence**.

AI models — whether built in-house or licensed from vendors — **depend on diverse, high-quality, timely data**.
The ability to access, exchange, and govern this data across organizational boundaries will become a defining advantage.

But this future requires infrastructure that does not exist today.
Organizations will need:

- **Cross-cloud interoperability** (AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, etc.)
- **Cross-region compliance** (ensuring GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI, and local data sovereignty laws are respected)
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (data warehouses, lakes, open table formats like Iceberg/Delta/Hudi)
- **Governed and enforceable data contracts** that allow:
  - Expiring, revocable connections
  - Tiered and dynamic access (different clients, different rights)
  - Alerts, monitors, and audit trails for every shared dataset

**Dataporto builds this.**

## What Governed Data Sharing Looks Like

Governed data sharing is not just "sending files" — it’s **dynamic, secure, and reciprocal**.

- **Retail & Payments (AI for forecasting):**
  - _A retail chain shares store performance + future location data with Mastercard._
  - _In return, Mastercard provides anonymized cannibalization and forecasting insights from their payments data, powered by AI models._

- **Healthcare & Pharma (AI for drug discovery):**
  - _Hospitals share anonymized clinical trial outcomes with pharmaceutical companies._
  - _Pharma companies provide AI-driven predictive drug interaction and efficacy models back to the hospitals._

- **Logistics & E-commerce (AI for optimization):**
  - _A logistics provider shares delivery performance and route optimization data with an e-commerce giant._
  - _The e-commerce company shares AI-powered demand forecasts to help optimize fleet usage._

- **Energy & Climate (AI for prediction):**
  - _A renewable energy startup shares real-time turbine and solar output data with a climate research institute._
  - _In exchange, the institute provides AI-enhanced weather and climate forecasting models to optimize renewable power grids._

- **Financial Services & Startups (AI for risk & fraud):**
  - _A fintech shares user transaction trends with a bank._
  - _The bank provides AI-powered risk scoring and fraud detection models back to the fintech._

## The Next 5 Years: The AI-Driven Data Economy

In the next five years, the landscape will shift dramatically:

- **AI Will Drive Data Demand**
  Every enterprise will need to feed AI models with **diverse, governed datasets** from external partners — not just internal sources.

- **Data Exchanges Will Become the Norm**
  Just as companies use APIs today, they will soon expect plug-and-play **data contracts** across vendors, clients, and partners to power AI pipelines.

- **Multi-Format Interoperability Will Be Required**
  Enterprises will demand that their partners support **Snowflake Data Shares, Databricks Delta Sharing, Iceberg, Postgres, and even sFTP feeds** — all with governance baked in.

- **Regulatory Pressures Will Increase**
  As AI usage expands, governments will enforce stricter compliance, demanding **audit trails, expiration, masking, lineage, and consent tracking** for AI training data.

- **Data Products Will Be Monetized**
  Vendors will sell **AI-ready datasets and model feeds** — priced, contracted, and monitored just like SaaS subscriptions.

- **Data Will Be Dynamic, Not Static**
  Instead of CSVs and APIs, companies will share **live, governed, zero-copy feeds** that evolve over time, with clear versioning and non-breaking change contracts.
