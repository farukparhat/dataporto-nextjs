# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a Snowflake account to use Dataporto?

No. That’s the beauty of Dataporto — we run the Snowflake infrastructure for you. Your clients can receive data in their own Snowflake accounts or via Reader Accounts we provision for them.

---

### What types of data sources can I connect?

You can connect databases (Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, Redshift, BigQuery), cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob), or even existing warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks). We’re continuously adding more integrations.

---

### How is this different from just sending CSVs or APIs?

CSV exports and APIs are brittle, slow, and hard to scale per client. Dataporto gives your clients **live, zero-copy warehouse access** — the format enterprises now expect. It’s instant, governed, and always up to date.

---

### Is the data secure?

Yes. Dataporto is built with enterprise-grade security: encrypted at rest and in transit, strict IAM controls, row/column masking, and full audit logging. SOC 2 compliance is on our roadmap.

---

### What if my client doesn’t have Snowflake?

No problem. We can provision a free **Snowflake Reader Account** for them, or deliver the same governed data via Databricks Delta Sharing or sFTP feeds.

---

### How hard is onboarding?

Onboarding is **zero-code**. Connect your source, define what data to share, and Dataporto takes care of staging, provisioning, and governance. Most vendors go live in hours, not weeks.

---

### How much does it cost?

We price based on the number of clients you share data with and the volume of data processed. No upfront Snowflake contract or engineering overhead required.

---

### Who is Dataporto for?

- SaaS vendors who deliver analytics to enterprise customers
- Agencies providing client-specific metrics and dashboards
- Data providers selling curated datasets
- Platforms that want governed, multi-client data access at scale

---

### Can I revoke or update access once it’s shared?

Yes. You stay in full control. Dataporto makes it easy to update, revoke, or expire shares on a per-client basis at any time.
