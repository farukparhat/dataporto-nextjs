## Usage Notes

- **$1/store/month** - Typically for base data feeds (raw reviews, responses)
- **$2/store/month** - Light enrichment (basic sentiment, incident detection)
- **$4/store/month** - Standard enrichment (full Tier 1 + Tier 2 data)
- **$10/store/month** - Premium tier (includes benchmarks, competitive insights, best practices)

For tiered pricing (e.g., Base + Enriched + Premium), add the per-store prices together.

Example: A customer taking all three tiers at $1 (base) + $4.5 (enriched) + $8 (premium) = $13.5/store/month

## Formula

```
Annual Revenue = (Price per Store per Month) × (Number of Stores) × 12 months
```
