## 🧠 Why Now?

> **Enterprise clients are demanding flexible, secure data sharing options that fit their existing infrastructure.**

Modern enterprises use diverse data platforms — Snowflake, Databricks, traditional file systems, and more.
If you can't deliver data in their preferred format, you're falling behind competitors who can.

Dataporto gives you enterprise-level data sharing capabilities across multiple platforms — without requiring you to build or maintain complex integrations yourself.
