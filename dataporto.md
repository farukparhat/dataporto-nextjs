Company Name: DataPorto

Goal:

- make your data self serve for customers
    - customers can set up and manage automated data feeds for their own data via their preferred protocls
        - Snowflake data share
        - Databricks delta share
        - sFTP or FTP
        - OneDrive, Google Drive

### Why Now?

> Over the last few years, two things have converged:
> 
1. **Enterprises have massively adopted cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks.**
    - Data is no longer trapped in on-prem systems — it’s queryable, scalable, and API-accessible.
2. **The demand for real-time, governed data collaboration across organizations has exploded.**
    - Whether it’s vendors sending performance metrics to clients, or partners needing live data feeds, the old way — APIs, CSVs, FTPs — is too slow, brittle, and insecure.

Meanwhile, tools like

**Snowflake Data Share**

**there’s still no turnkey SaaS**

We’re sitting at the intersection of a

**technical unlock**

**market readiness moment**

In short:

**now is the first time the infrastructure, expectations, and opportunity have aligned.**

### For Investors:

Data is the new API — and companies are realizing they can’t build partnerships, revenue streams, or client stickiness without a data-sharing strategy. We’re enabling the next layer of the cloud data stack: **data distribution**.

### For Customers:

Clients expect self-serve, up-to-date data from vendors. Instead of building brittle APIs or dashboards, vendors can now offer **direct, governed access to the raw truth**

You’d build a **multi-tenant SaaS** product where:

### **🔹 Vendors (your customers):**

- Upload or replicate their data into Snowflake (or you do it for them).
- Define what they want to share and with whom.
- Monitor usage, revoke access, manage clients.

### **🔹 Clients (data consumers):**

- Get secure, live, read-only access to the data.
- Either through their own Snowflake accounts, or via **Reader Accounts** you manage.

| **Snowflake Data Share** | Enables secure, zero-copy sharing of data. |
| --- | --- |
| **Reader Accounts** | Lets you serve clients without their own Snowflake licenses. |
| **RBAC / Schema-level access** | Enables scoped, isolated sharing per customer. |
| **Usage metering** | You can track compute & bill accordingly. |
| **Marketplace integration** | You could even publish datasets on the Snowflake Data Exchange. |

### **Vendor Flow:**

1. Vendor signs up → You create a Snowflake schema or DB for them.
2. Vendor uploads data or connects their DB (e.g., via Fivetran, DMS).
3. Vendor defines client access (what to share and to whom).
4. Your SaaS creates the **Snowflake Share** programmatically.

### **Client Flow:**

- If the client has a Snowflake account → They receive the share.
- If not → You spin up a **Reader Account**, isolate access, and provide credentials.

| **Type** | **What You Enable** |
| --- | --- |
| **B2B Analytics Platform** | Deliver insights/data directly into client Snowflake |
| **Data Aggregator** | Sell industry or benchmarking data to subscribers |
| **API-less Reporting Layer** | Offer data “feeds” to clients without building APIs |
| **Embedded Data Monetization** | Let vendors resell their own data via your platform |

Snowflake supports:

- **Fine-grained access control**
- **Auditing and usage tracking**
- **Role-based access per client or vendor**
- **Private connectivity (e.g., VPC peering, PrivateLink)**

## **💸 Monetization Ideas**

- **Per client seat** (charge vendors for each client they share with)
- **Storage & compute markup**
- **Premium features** (alerts, dashboards, transformations)
- **Usage-based pricing** (based on query volume or rows scanned)
