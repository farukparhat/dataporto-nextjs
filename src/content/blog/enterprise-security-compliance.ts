# Enterprise Security and Compliance in Data Sharing

Enterprise data sharing must balance accessibility with security and compliance. This comprehensive guide covers SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and industry-specific requirements for data sharing platforms.

## Compliance Framework Overview

### SOC 2 Type II Requirements
- **Security**: Logical and physical access controls
- **Availability**: System uptime and performance monitoring
- **Processing Integrity**: Accurate data processing
- **Confidentiality**: Protection of confidential information
- **Privacy**: Collection and use of personal information

### GDPR Requirements
- **Lawful basis** for processing personal data
- **Data minimization** and purpose limitation
- **Right to erasure** (right to be forgotten)
- **Data portability** and access rights
- **Privacy by design** in system architecture

### Industry-Specific Standards
- **HIPAA** (Healthcare): PHI protection and access controls
- **SOX** (Financial): Data integrity and audit trails
- **PCI DSS** (Payments): Cardholder data protection
- **FERPA** (Education): Student record privacy

## Security Architecture

### Data-in-Transit Protection
- **TLS 1.3 encryption** for all data transmission
- **Certificate pinning** for API communications
- **VPN connectivity** for enterprise clients
- **Private network peering** for cloud-to-cloud transfers

### Data-at-Rest Security
- **AES-256 encryption** for all stored data
- **Customer-managed keys** (CMK) support
- **Hardware security modules** (HSM) for key management
- **Secure key rotation** policies

### Access Controls
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Multi-factor authentication** (MFA)
- **Single sign-on** (SSO) integration
- **Just-in-time access** for administrative functions

## Governance Implementation

### Data Classification
Implement systematic data classification:

\`\`\`yaml
data_classification:
  public:
    description: "Data intended for public consumption"
    controls: ["basic_audit"]
    
  internal:
    description: "Internal business data"
    controls: ["access_logging", "encryption_at_rest"]
    
  confidential:
    description: "Sensitive business information"
    controls: ["access_logging", "encryption_transit", "approval_required"]
    
  restricted:
    description: "Highly sensitive data (PII, PHI)"
    controls: ["all_security_controls", "data_masking", "audit_trail"]
\`\`\`

### Policy Engine
Automated policy enforcement:

\`\`\`python
# Example governance policy
healthcare_policy = {
    "name": "HIPAA_Compliance_Policy",
    "rules": [
        {
            "field": "patient_ssn",
            "action": "mask",
            "pattern": "***-**-{last_4}",
            "applies_to": ["external_researchers"]
        },
        {
            "field": "diagnosis_date",
            "action": "date_shift",
            "range_days": 365,
            "applies_to": ["analytics_team"]
        },
        {
            "table": "patient_records",
            "filter": "treatment_date >= date_sub(now(), interval 2 year)",
            "applies_to": ["all_users"]
        }
    ],
    "audit_requirements": {
        "log_all_access": true,
        "retention_period": "7_years",
        "real_time_monitoring": true
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Audit and Monitoring

### Comprehensive Audit Trail
Track all data access and operations:

- **User authentication** events
- **Data access** patterns and queries
- **Policy changes** and approvals
- **System configuration** modifications
- **Data export** and sharing activities

### Real-time Monitoring
Implement continuous monitoring:

\`\`\`python
# Monitoring configuration
monitoring_rules = [
    {
        "name": "unusual_access_pattern",
        "condition": "access_volume > baseline * 3",
        "action": "alert_security_team",
        "severity": "high"
    },
    {
        "name": "after_hours_access",
        "condition": "access_time not in business_hours",
        "action": "require_justification",
        "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
        "name": "bulk_data_export",
        "condition": "export_size > 1GB",
        "action": "require_approval",
        "severity": "high"
    }
]
\`\`\`

### Compliance Reporting
Automated compliance reporting:

- **SOC 2 controls** effectiveness reports
- **GDPR data processing** activity reports
- **Access review** reports for certification
- **Incident response** documentation

## Data Protection Techniques

### Dynamic Data Masking
Protect sensitive data in real-time:

\`\`\`sql
-- Client-specific masking views
CREATE VIEW client_customer_data AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN CLIENT_POLICY() = 'full_access' THEN email
    WHEN CLIENT_POLICY() = 'masked' THEN CONCAT('***@', SPLIT(email, '@')[1])
    ELSE NULL
  END as email,
  CASE 
    WHEN CLIENT_POLICY() IN ('full_access', 'partial') THEN phone
    ELSE '***-***-' + RIGHT(phone, 4)
  END as phone
FROM customer_data
WHERE applies_data_filter(CLIENT_ID());
\`\`\`

### Tokenization
Replace sensitive data with tokens:

- **Format-preserving** tokenization
- **Reversible** tokens with proper authorization
- **Cross-system** token consistency
- **Token lifecycle** management

### Data Minimization
Share only necessary data:

- **Column-level** filtering
- **Row-level** security
- **Time-based** data windows
- **Purpose-based** access control

## Privacy Engineering

### Privacy by Design
Embed privacy controls in architecture:

1. **Data minimization** at collection
2. **Purpose limitation** enforcement
3. **Consent management** integration
4. **Automated deletion** workflows

### Right to Erasure Implementation

\`\`\`python
def process_erasure_request(subject_id, verification_token):
    # 1. Verify request authenticity
    if not verify_erasure_request(subject_id, verification_token):
        raise UnauthorizedErasureRequest()
    
    # 2. Identify all data for subject
    data_locations = find_all_subject_data(subject_id)
    
    # 3. Check for legal holds
    legal_holds = check_legal_obligations(subject_id)
    if legal_holds:
        return schedule_erasure_after_hold_expiry(subject_id, legal_holds)
    
    # 4. Execute erasure across all systems
    for location in data_locations:
        secure_delete(location, subject_id)
    
    # 5. Generate compliance certificate
    return generate_erasure_certificate(subject_id)
\`\`\`

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Workflow
Structured response to security events:

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve controls

### Breach Notification
Automated breach notification process:

\`\`\`python
def handle_potential_breach(incident_details):
    # 1. Assess breach severity
    severity = assess_breach_severity(incident_details)
    
    # 2. Determine notification requirements
    notification_rules = get_notification_requirements(
        affected_data_types=incident_details.data_types,
        affected_jurisdictions=incident_details.jurisdictions
    )
    
    # 3. Notify relevant parties
    if severity >= "material":
        # Regulatory notifications (72 hours for GDPR)
        notify_regulators(incident_details, notification_rules)
        
        # Client notifications
        notify_affected_clients(incident_details)
        
        # Internal stakeholders
        notify_internal_teams(incident_details)
    
    # 4. Document for compliance
    create_incident_record(incident_details, actions_taken)
\`\`\`

## Vendor Management

### Third-Party Risk Assessment
Evaluate security posture of vendors:

- **SOC 2 Type II** reports review
