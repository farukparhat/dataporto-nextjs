    question: "Do I need a Snowflake account to use DataPorto?",
    answer:
      "No. That's the beauty of DataPorto — we run the Snowflake infrastructure for you. Your clients can receive data in their own Snowflake accounts or via Reader Accounts we provision for them.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of data sources can I connect?",
    answer:
      "You can connect databases (Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, Redshift, BigQuery), cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob), or even existing warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks). We're continuously adding more integrations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from just sending CSVs or APIs?",
    answer:
      "CSV exports and APIs are brittle, slow, and hard to scale per client. DataPorto gives your clients live, zero-copy warehouse access — the format enterprises now expect. It's instant, governed, and always up to date.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the data secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. DataPorto is built with enterprise-grade security: encrypted at rest and in transit, strict IAM controls, row/column masking, and full audit logging. SOC 2 compliance is on our roadmap.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my client doesn't have Snowflake?",
    answer:
      "No problem. We can provision a free Snowflake Reader Account for them, or deliver the same governed data via Databricks Delta Sharing or sFTP feeds.",
  },
  {
    question: "How hard is onboarding?",
    answer:
      "Onboarding is zero-code. Connect your source, define what data to share, and DataPorto takes care of staging, provisioning, and governance. Most vendors go live in hours, not weeks.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "We price based on the number of clients you share data with and the volume of data processed. No upfront Snowflake contract or engineering overhead required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is DataPorto for?",
    answer:
      "SaaS vendors who deliver analytics to enterprise customers, agencies providing client-specific metrics and dashboards, data providers selling curated datasets, and platforms that want governed, multi-client data access at scale.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I revoke or update access once it's shared?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You stay in full control. DataPorto makes it easy to update, revoke, or expire shares on a per-client basis at any time.",
  },
