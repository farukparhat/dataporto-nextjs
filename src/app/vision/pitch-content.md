# Dataporto Pitch Deck (Sequoia Format)

---

## Company Purpose

**Dataporto enables SaaS companies to share governed, large-scale data with enterprise clients — via Snowflake, Databricks, or sFTP — without building or maintaining custom pipelines.**

---

## Problem

- Enterprises increasingly demand **Snowflake or Databricks data shares** as the default delivery method.
- Vendors today struggle to meet this expectation:
  - **APIs** → brittle, expensive to integrate, not warehouse-native
  - **sFTP feeds** → fragile, insecure, difficult to maintain client-by-client
  - **Custom Snowflake setups** → heavy engineering overhead, slow to implement
- Result: slow enterprise onboarding, lost deals, wasted engineering resources.

---

## Solution

- **Dataporto: Data Sharing as a Service**
  - **Connect** → Ingest directly from vendor databases, warehouses, or storage
  - **Catalog** → Define tables, views, schemas to expose
  - **Share** → Provision Snowflake Shares, Databricks Delta Shares, or sFTP feeds instantly
  - **Govern** → Enforce permissions, masking, and audit logging
- Eureka: Vendors can now deliver data the way enterprises expect — without engineering lift.
- Durable advantage: Dataporto becomes the **control plane for cross-platform data sharing**.

---

## Why Now

- **Snowflake & Databricks adoption exploding** → warehouse-native sharing is the new gold standard.
- Enterprises are consolidating all data into centralized warehouses → demand frictionless integration.
- SaaS vendors producing more valuable, granular data than ever before → need a delivery mechanism.
- Enterprises need clean, governed, and centralized data from vendors ready to fuel AI.

---

## Market Potential

- **Initial ICP:** SaaS vendors and data providers serving enterprise clients
  - CX platforms (Momos, Tattle, OfOne, Medallia)
  - Analytics vendors, data marketplaces, agencies
- **TAM:** Data integration / sharing market estimated **$20–30B+**
- Dataporto can **create a new category**: Governed Data Sharing as a Service.

---

## Competition / Alternatives

- **APIs** → brittle, costly to maintain, not client-friendly
- **sFTP** → insecure, fragile, poor enterprise adoption
- **Custom Snowflake/Databricks setups** → heavy engineering burden
- **Adjacent players (Fivetran, Hightouch)** → focus on ingestion/activation, not vendor-to-client sharing
- **Dataporto** → only end-to-end service for SaaS-to-enterprise governed data sharing

---

## Business Model

- Combination of
- Pricing based on **number of client connections / data products shared**
- Usage based pricing based on tokens/rows shared
- Predictable for enterprises, scalable with vendor growth
- Expansion opportunities: premium governance, usage analytics, multi-platform connectors

---

## Team

- **Faruk Parhat (Founder & CEO)**
  - Director of Data Engineering, Restaurant Brands International (RBI)
    - Led **80+ vendor integrations** (APIs, sFTP, Snowflake)
    - Managed data engineering team for 1,000+ stores (Burger King, Popeyes, Tim Hortons, Firehouse Subs)
  - Microsoft alum, MIT background
- Advisory network: SaaS founders, Snowflake ecosystem leaders

---

## Financials

- Pre-revenue, early conversations with design partners (Momos, Tattle, OfOne)
- **Planned raise:** $1.2M angel round
- Use of funds:
  - Product build (Snowflake + Databricks connectors)
  - SOC 2 compliance
  - Secure first 5–10 design partners
  - Launch GA + target $100K ARR within 12 months

---

## Vision

Dataporto will be the global standard for how businesses exchange data

- Become the **default way businesses share large-scale data** with each other — secure, governed, and instant.
- Enable organizations to **leverage their data as a revenue channel** — to trade, exchange, and monetize insights.
- Set the **standard for compliance and regulatory requirements** in data sharing (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) — the “Vanta for inter-company data exchange.”
- Expand across platforms — Snowflake, Databricks, Postgres, S3, Redshift — **wherever enterprise data lives.**
