# LinkedIn Post Ideas for DataPorto

## 🔹 Thought Leadership / Educational

1. **The API vs Data Share Debate**
   Compare APIs, file drops, and Snowflake Data Sharing. Highlight governance, cost, and customer expectations. Conclude that the future is governed, zero-copy sharing.

2. **Data Is Becoming a Resource**
   Talk about how data is evolving into an asset that gets bought, sold, and traded. Show how Snowflake Data Sharing is one of the first steps toward that future, and how DataPorto makes it accessible to everyone.

3. **The Hidden Cost of CSV Exports**
   Walk through the inefficiency, errors, and governance gaps of emailing CSVs. Position live data sharing as the next step.

## 🔹 Storytelling / Founder’s Journey

4. **Why I Built DataPorto**
   Personal story: as a data engineer, you saw how painful it was for vendors to share data with clients. Snowflake solved it for enterprises—but not for everyone. That’s why you built DataPorto.

5. **What Customers Told Me**
   Share a real anecdote from a potential design partner:
   “We needed Snowflake Shares, but didn’t want to buy/manage Snowflake ourselves…”
   → DataPorto solves that.

7. **Your Data. Their Snowflake. Our Infrastructure.**
   Use this tagline in a post showing a simple diagram of how DataPorto connects vendor data → Snowflake → clients.

8. **Multi-Method Data Delivery**
   Explain that not every client wants data the same way: some want Snowflake, some Databricks, some SFTP. DataPorto makes it all possible from a single platform.

## 🔹 Provocative / Conversation Starters
