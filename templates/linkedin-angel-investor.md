Hi <Investor Name>,

I saw your angel investments in <...>.

My background includes Microsoft and MIT, and at RBI I led data engineering across 15+ vendors, where I saw firsthand how challenging it is for SaaS vendors to share data with enterprise clients (APIs, sFTP, S3, Snowflake Shares).

That experience led me to start Dataporto, which aims to become the future of SaaS → enterprise data sharing, enabling governed Snowflake, Databricks, or sFTP shares without engineering overhead for both vendor and client.

If this is a space you’re interested in, I’d love to get your advice on the early direction.

Best,
Faruk
